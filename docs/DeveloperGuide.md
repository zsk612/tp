## 3. <a id="design">Design</a>
This section provides a high level overview of our application, The Schwarzenegger.
### 3.1. <a id="architect">Architecture</a>

![Architecture](pictures/zesong/Architecture.png)

The image above explains the design of the application, The Schwarzenegger. 

The main driver of the application is `Main: Duke`. It is responsible for mainly two phases:
- At application launch
    - This class will initialise the components in the correct sequence and is in charge of connecting them with each other.
- At shut down
    - This class will invoke cleanup method for the components when necessary.
    
In addition to that, the architecture of The Schwarzenegger is broken down into several packages, mainly the following: 
- `Ui`: This class mainly handles the interactions with user of the application.
- `Parser`: This class mainly handles the parsing and handling of user commands.
- `Command`: This class handles the type of command.
- `Profile`: This class manages the data of the user.
- `Diet`: This class manages the diet recording sessions.
- `Workout`: This class manages the data workout recording sessions.
- `Storage`: This class reads data from and writes data back into a text file for future uses.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.2. <a id="ui-component">Ui Component</a>
![Ui Component](images/UI_Component.png)

API: `Ui.java`
 
The `Ui` package is a combination class where all interaction will be made through this component
 
The `Ui` component,

* Takes in user input
* Prints out response messages

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.3. <a id="logic-component">Logic Component</a>

![Logic Component](images/logic_update.png)

1. `The Schwarzenegger` uses `Parser` classes to parse the user command.
2. This splits the user input into interpretable portions by other functions.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.4. <a id="model-component">Model Component</a>

![Model Component](pictures/zesong/model.png)

The Model component contains `Profile`, `DietManager`,
`PastRecord` and `WorkoutSession` classes.
* Profile: Stores the user profile data.
* DietManager: Stores all past diet records.
* PastRecord: Stores meta information of each WorkoutSession files.
* WorkoutSession: Stores the exercise data done in each workout session.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.5. <a id="storage-component">Storage Component</a>

![Storage Class Diagram](images/Storage.png)

Profiles, Diet sessions and Workout sessions are stored in separate folders. 

The Storage package contains subpackages for profile, diet manager and workout manager.

The readDietSession() method in storage.diet package is used for loading saved diet sessions, which are loaded when the user wants to edit a past diet session.
readPastRecords() and readFileContents() methods in storage.workout package are used for loading saved workout managers and workout sessions respectively. It is called when the user accesses the workout manager.
loadData() from storage.profile is used to load user profile data and is called when the program starts up. 

The writeToStorageDietSession() method in storage.diet package saves the diet session and is called when the user exits it.
writePastRecords() and writeToStorage() methods in storage.workout package are used to save the workout managers and workout sessions respectively. It is called when the user exists the workout manager.

The saveData() method in storage.profile is called after the user creates the user profile or edits it.
readData() is storage.profile is called when duke starts up.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.6. <a id="common-classes">Common Classes</a> 
Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.duke` and the `ui` package, specifically Constant.java and CommonUi.java.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

## 4. <a id="implementation">Implementation</a>
This section describes some details on how the features are being implemented. All profile/ diet/ workout-related features.


All profile/ diet/ workout-related features can be broken down into 4 distinct functionality, addition, viewing/ listing, deletion and editing.
For diet and workout-related features, there is an additional functionality of searching.

### 4.1. <a id="main-menu-related-features">Main Menu-related Features</a>

#### 4.1.1. <a id="main-help">Help Command for Main Menu</a>

The `help` command allows users to view all the available commands in the main page. The command for showing help message is `help`.

#### 4.1.2. <a id="redirecting-to-profile-menu">Redirecting to Profile Menu</a>

The redirection to profile page allows the user to enter Profile Menu to create, edit, view and delete user profile. The command for this redirection is `profile`.

#### 4.1.3. <a id="redirecting-to-diet-menu">Redirecting to Diet Menu</a>

The redirection to profile page allows the user to enter Diet Menu to create, edit, list and delete diet sessions. The command for this redirection is `diet`.

#### 4.1.4. <a id="redirecting-to-workout-menu">Redirecting to Workout Menu</a>

The redirection to profile page allows the user to enter Workout Menu to create, edit, list and delete workout sessions. The command for this redirection is `workout`.

### 4.2. <a id="profile-related-features">Profile-related Features</a>
#### 4.2.1. <a id="adding-a-profile">Adding a Profile</a>

This feature allows user to add a new profile. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. invalid command format. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the creation is successful, a confirmation message on the newly created profile will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to add a new profile, the ProfileSession, Ui, ProfileParser, Command, CommandLib, ProfileStorage, Profile and CommandResult classes will be accessed, and the following sequence of actions is called to prompt execution result to user:

1. User executes `add /n Schwarzenegger /h 188 /w 113 /e 100 /c 2500`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.getCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `ProfileAdd` object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ProfileAdd`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileAdd.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ProfileAdd` calls `ProfileStorage.loadData()` to load existing profile in the system. If there is an existing profile, `ProfileAdd` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`.
    1. `ProfileAdd` calls `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()` to parse user input into specific tags and information. 
    1. Based on the parsed information from `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()`, `ProfileAdd` creates a new `Profile`.
    1. `ProfileAdd` calls `ProfileStorage.saveData()` to save the `Profile` object.
    1. `ProfileAdd` returns a successful result to `ProfileSession`.
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommandResult.getFeedbackMessage()` to get the execution feedback message.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All descriptions, warnings and responses will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how creating a new profile works:

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/khoa/AddProfile.png)

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/khoa/ParseInput.png)

**Design considerations**

Parsing of the userâ€™s input command:

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Userâ€™s command is split into size 2 array first containing command type and command arguments. Then arguments are split into command tag and information pairs.  

    - Pros: Command tags do not have to follow a fixed order. 
    - Cons: It takes multiple steps in parsing the command.

- **Alternative 2:** Userâ€™s command is divided by space.

    - Pros: The parsing can be easily done by calling Java built-in function `split()`. Supports multiple tags or no tags.
    - Cons: Values for each variable cannot contain spaces which makes the application restrictive, especially for user's name.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

#### 4.2.2. <a id="viewing-a-profile">Viewing a Profile</a>
This feature allows user to view added profile with calculated BMI based on height and weight. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. redundant parameters. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the data loading is successful, a message on the added profile will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to view an added profile, the ProfileSession, Ui, ProfileParser, Command, CommandLib, ProfileStorage, Profile, DietManager and CommandResult classes will be accessed. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `view`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `ProfileView` object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ProfileView`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileView.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ProfileView` calls `ProfileStorage.loadData()` to load existing profile in the system. If there is no existing profile, `ProfileView` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`.
    1. `ProfileView` calls `DietManager.getTodayTotalCalories()` to get user's calories intake today.
    1. Based on user's calories intake today and string representation of `Profile`, `ProfileView` returns a result to `ProfileSession`.    
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommandResult.getCommandResult()` to get the `CommandResult` object.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All descriptions, warnings and responses will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how viewing an added profile works:

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/khoa/ViewProfile.png)

**Design considerations**

Aspects: Loading of stored data

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** call public methods of Storage class to 
load the profile from hard disk every time the user wants to view profile.

    - Pros: Profile data is up-to-date if the user prefers to edit it in text file rather than using commands in The Schwarzenegger.
    - Cons: Execution time is slow down due to multiple times of loading the data.

- **Alternative 2:** call public methods of Storage class to load the profile from hard disk only when user enters Profile Menu.

    - Pros: Execution time is fast. 
    - Cons: Profile data is not updated in real time if user edits it in text editor while running The Schwarzenegger.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

#### 4.2.3. <a id="editing-a-profile">Editing a Profile</a>
This feature allows user to anytime go back to edit a profile created in the past such as editing physique data and expected daily calories intake. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. invalid command format. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the editing is successful, a confirmation message on the edited profile will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to edit a profile, the ProfileSession, Ui, ProfileParser, Command, CommandLib, ProfileStorage, Profile and CommandResult classes will be accessed, and the following sequence of actions is called to prompt execution result to user:

1. User executes `edit /w 60`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.getCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `ProfileEdit` object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ProfileEdit`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileEdit.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ProfileEdit` calls `ProfileStorage.loadData()` to load existing profile in the system. If there is no existing profile, `ProfileAdd` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`.
    1. `ProfileEdit` calls `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()` to parse user input into specific tags and information.
    1. Based on the parsed information from `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()`, `ProfileEdit` creates a new `Profile`.
    1. `ProfileEdit` calls `Profile.equals()` to compare the newly created and existing profile. If there are no changes, `ProfileEdit` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `6`.
    1. `ProfileEdit` calls `ProfileStorage.saveData()` to save the newly created `Profile` object.
    1. `ProfileAdd` returns a successful result to `ProfileSession`.
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommandResult.getFeedbackMessage()` to get the execution feedback message.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All descriptions, warnings and responses will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how creating a new profile works:

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/khoa/EditProfile.png)

**Design considerations**

Parsing of the userâ€™s input command:

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Userâ€™s command is split into size 2 array first containing command type and command arguments. Then arguments are split into command tag and information pairs.  

    - Pros: Command tags do not have to follow a fixed order.
    - Cons: It takes multiple steps in parsing the command.

- **Alternative 2:** Userâ€™s command is divided by space.

#### 4.2.4. <a id="deleting-a-profile">Deleting a Profile</a>

This feature allows user to delete a profile created in the past. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. redundant parameters. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the deletion is successful, a confirmation message on the profile deletion will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to delete an added profile, the ProfileSession, Ui, ProfileParser, Command, CommandLib, ProfileStorage, Profile and CommandResult classes will be accessed. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `delete`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `ProfileDelete` object.
   1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ProfileDelete`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileDelete.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ProfileDelete` calls `ProfileStorage.loadData()` to load existing profile in the system. If there is no existing profile, `ProfileDelete` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`.
    1. `ProfileDelete` calls `Ui.CheckConfirmation()` to get user's confirmation on the deletion since this action is irrevocable. If user  fails to confirm, `ProfileDelete` returns an abort result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `4`.
    1. `ProfileDelete` calls `ProfileStorage.saveData()` to save a `null` object which represents a deleted profile.
    1. `ProfileDelete` returns a result to `ProfileSession`.   
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommandResult.getFeedbackMessage()` to get the execution feedback message.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All descriptions, warnings and responses will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how deleting an added profile works:

**Design considerations**

Aspects: Loading of stored data

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** call public methods of Storage class to load the profile from hard disk every time the user wants to delete profile.

    - Pros: Profile data is up-to-date if the user prefers to edit it in text file rather than using commands in The Schwarzenegger.
    - Cons: Execution time is slow down due to loading the data.

- **Alternative 2:** call public methods of Storage class to load the profile from hard disk when user enter Profile Menu.

    - Pros: Execution time is fast. 
    - Cons: Profile data is not updated in real time if user edits it in text file while running The Schwarzenegger.

### 4.3. Diet-related Features
#### 4.3.1. Listing out all commands: `help`
This command lists out all help commands in a typed list that indicates to the user all the commands available and how to use them.

**Implementation**  
When the user types `help` in a Diet Manager instance, the following sequence occurs. 
1. The user keys in `help`.
    
    1. A `DietSessionUi` component will call `dietSessionUI.getInput()`. 
    1. Input will be parsed in `processCommand()`.   
    
2. Creation of `DietSessionHelp` command object from input
    1. This will create a `DietSessionHelp()` instantiation of which the method `execute()` is called.
    
3. Executing Command
    1. The execute() method will call print out the list of commands onto the console with printHelpFormatter() from static CommonUi.java.
[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

#### 4.3.2. Start recording diet data: `new`
The feature allows users to start recording diet data. 

**Implementation**  
When the user types `new </d [DATE]> </t [TAG]>` the following sequence occurs. 
1. The user keys in `new /d 2020-05-04 /t breakfast`.
    
    1. A `DietSessionUi` component will call `dietSessionUI.getInput()`. 
    1. Input will be parsed in `processCommand()`, which splits the input into the `command` and the `input`.   
    
2. Creation of command object from input
    1. This will create an instantiation DietSessionCreate() command object of which the method execute() is called.
    
3. Executing Command
    1. The newly created object will then create an instantiation of a `DietSession`, and call the `start()` method.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how creating new diet session works:

### 4.4. <a id="workout-related-features">Workout-related Features</a>
#### 4.4.1. <a id="creating-a-new-workout-session">Creating a New Workout Session</a>

Users can create a new workout session. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified 
of the reason, e.g. invalid command or IO related errors. The action will be aborted. If the creation is successful, 
the user will go into the new workout session to edit the exercises in that session.

The user can specify tags for the session. Creation time, last edit time and saving file name will be auto generated 
by the application and saved. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to create a new workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser 
and CommandLib class will be accessed and the following sequence of 
actions are called to return a command object NewWs.

1. User executes `new /t leg chest`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `NewWs`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `NewWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `NewWS` parse the arguments to identify the tags
    3. `NewWS` calls `PastRecordList.add()` to create a new file to store information in this session. 
    If the creation fails, the action is aborted. Else, this record will be stored and the file path will 
    be returned.
    4. `NewWS` creates a new `WorkoutSession` Object with the file path. 
    5.  `NewWS` calls `workoutSession. workoutSessionStart()` so that user can add information into this session.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.
The following sequence diagram shows how the new command works

The sequence diagram below summarizes how creating new workout session works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/NewWS.png)
**Design considerations**
Parsing of the userâ€™s input command:  

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Userâ€™s commands are divided by space.

    - Pros: The parsing can be easily done by calling Java built-in function .split(). Supports multiple tags or no tags.
    - Cons: Values for each variable cannot contain spaces which makes the application restrictive.

- **Alternative 2:** Multiple prompts for userâ€™s input of a workout data.

    - Pros: Users would not have to make sure that their command is syntactically right. 
    - Cons: The constant prompting could subject the application to a negative experience in the difficulty to use the commands.

#### 4.4.2. Listing past workout sessions
The feature to list workoutSessions allows the user to view a summary of all the history workout sessions, including their index, creation date and tags.

**Implementation**
When the user attempts to list workoutSessions, the WorkoutManger, WorkoutManagerParse, ListWS and WorkoutManagerStorage class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `list /s 20201010 /e 20201025`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array

1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/ListWS.png)

**Design considerations**
Aspects: Security of stored data

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** call public methods of Storage class to 
print the list

    - Pros: pastRecord are private and it can only be manipulated through designed public methods. Only selected data will be printed and viewed.
    - Cons: Most methods Storage needs to be a static.

- **Alternative 2:** Storage return a readonly list of pastRecord.

    - Pros: More versatile operations can be done.
    - Cons: All data of pastRecord will be exposed.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

#### 4.4.3. Editing workout session
User can anytime go back to edit a workout session created in the past such as
adding or removing exercies in that session.

Each past workout session is stored in a different file name following its creation time.
The meta information of these past records such as file name, creation time are
stored in another file which will be loaded as the program initlises.
The actual workout session record will only be loaded if needed e.g. when editting is called. 

**Implementation**
When the user attempts to edit a past workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser, CommandLib and WorkoutStorage class will be accessed and the following sequence of 
actions are called.

1. User executes `edit 1`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `EditWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `EditWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    3. `EditWS` calls `PastRecordList.edit()` to locate the file. If the does not exist, the action is aborted. Else, `PastRecordList` updates the meta information of the file and write to local storage. The file path will be returned.
    4. `EditWS` creates a new `WorkoutSession` Object with the file path. `WorkoutSession` is initilised by loading the data in the file.
    5.  `EditWS` calls `workoutSession.workoutSessionStart()` so that user start editing this session.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.
The following sequence diagram shows how the new command works

The sequence diagram below summarizes how editting past record works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/EditWS.png)
**Design considerations**
Past record storage and model design:  

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** store past workout sessions in different files and their meta information in a separate file

    - Pros: Initialization will be faster as data loaded grows little even in long terms. 
    - Cons: Deleting files and creating files need to handle file names carefully.

- **Alternative 2:** Load all past records during initialization.

    - Pros:  Run time can retrieve data faster as there is no need to access data in hard disk. 
    - Cons: The application initialization will grow quickly as the application scales.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
#### 4.4.4. Deleting a workout session
User can delete a workout session created in the past by giving its index.

Each past workout session is stored in a different file name following its creation time. The meta information of these past records such as file name, creation time are stored in another file which will be loaded as the program initlises. When the user tries to delete a file, the application refers to the meta information of the file to locate the file and delete it. Then the meta information of the record will be deleted.

User can clear all data by iteratively delete the record until the meta data file is empty. To simplify that, user can use `clear` command to achieve that.

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to delete a past workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser, CommandLib
and WorkoutStorage class will be accessed and the following sequence of actions are called.

1. User executes `delete 1` or `clear`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `DeleteWS`
     or `clearWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `DeleteWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    3. `DeleteWS` calls `PastRecorList.delete()` to locate the file. If the does not exist, the action is aborted. Else, `PastRecorList` remove the meta information of the file and delete the local storage file.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how deleting past record works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/DeleteWS.png)

**Design considerations**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete `workoutSession` by specifying index of it.

    - Pros: Quick and easy deletion by using ArrayList.get().
    - Cons: Lesser alternatives for the user and user would have to identify the index first by executing `list` to get index of the session to be deleted.

- **Alternative 2:** Delete `workoutSession` by specifying `workoutSession` tags or dates.

    - Pros: More alternatives for users. Can bulk delete files with certain attributes. 
    - Cons: Tags and dates does not uniquely identify the record hence may result in accidental wrong deletion.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
#### 4.4.5. Searching based on conditions
The feature `search` allows the user to view a summary of all the history 
workout sessions which satisfies certain conditions.

The user can search by the date of creation, or the tags that the session has. User can put in 0
or 1 or 2 criteria during search. 


The user can attach variable number of tags after `/t` and one date after `/d`. The date must be specified in certain formats for it to be recognisable. Else, it will be treated as there is no date criteria given.
[See here](#appendix-g-supported-formats-of-date-input) for all supported formats.

The tag criterion selects sessions which contains all the tags that the user specified in the search. The date criterion selects the sessions which is created on that date. Only sessions that satisfies all conditions will be selected and displayed.

The result is displayed in a table with the index of the selected records so that users can easily do further operations on them, e.g. `delete` or `edit`.
 
 **Implementation**
 
When the user attempts to list workoutSessions, the WorkoutManger, DeleteWS, WorkoutManagerStorage and WorkoutManagerParse class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `search /t leg /d 20201017`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `SearchWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `SearchWS.execute()` to execute the command
    3. `SearchWS` calls `PastRecorList.search()`
    1. `PastRecorList` will call `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` to parse the arguments into an array of predicates
    1. `PastRecorList` filters the pastRecord arraylist and return a string representation of the filtered records to `WorkoutManager`
    6. `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how searching record works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/SearchWS.png)
**Design considerations**
Aspects: indexing the selected results

The index of a record is not stored in the schema because it easily varies with addition and deletion. Thus given a record, searching for its index will have higher time complexity.

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** print out the actual index of the record 
in the meta info file.

    - Pros: The index is useful for user to use for future actions.
    - Cons: Checking for the actual location complicates the search time complexity.

- **Alternative 2:** print out the index of the element in the result list.

    - Pros: Easy to implement. Low time complexity.
    - Cons: Since the index in result list is not the same as the index in actual record meta, user cannot use the index for further actions.

### 4.5. <a id="storage">Storage</a>
Storage in the application refers to storing files of user profile and workout, diet sessions into respective local subdirectories sorted based on time in a local directory called `/saves` which is in the same directory as the project root.

#### 4.5.1. <a id="storage-for-profile">Storage for Profile</a>

Storage for profile saves user profile created as `profile.json` in the `/saves/profile` directory. Profile data file is created as follows:
- `profile.json` is updated in the local hard disk after the user adds/ edits a profile by calling `ProfileAdd.execute()`/ `ProfileEdit.execute()`.
- `profile.json` content will be cleared after the user deletes a profile by calling `ProfileDelete.execute()`.

**Implementation**
Profile storage handles reading of file data by calling `loadData()` and overwriting of file data by calling `saveData()`.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
#### 4.5.2. <a id="storage-for-diet">Storage for Diet</a>

Storage for diet saves diet sessions created as individual files sorted based on the time created in the `/saves/diet` directory. Each diet session file is created as follows:
- Each file is created as a json file and named as `[DATE] [TAG].json`.
- A corresponding file is updated in the local file after the user edits a diet session by calling DietSessionEdit.execute().
- A corresponding file is deleted in the local file when the user deletes a diet session by calling DietSessionDelete.execute() or clears all diet sessions by calling DietSessionClear.execute().

**Implementation**
Storage handles reading of file data by calling readDietSession() and overwriting of file data by calling writeToStorageDietSession().

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
#### 4.5.3. <a id="storage-for-workout">Storage for Workout</a>

Storage for workout saves workout sessions created as individual files named based on the time created in `/saves/workout` directory. The metainformation of the files such as createion date and last edit date is saved in  `/saves/workout/history.json`.

Only history.json file is load when initilizing the application. The rest of Session files are load on request, e.g. `edit`. When a new workout session is created, a new file will be stored and its meta information will be appended to `history.json`. When a workout session is deleted, the file will be removed and its record will be removed from `history.json`.


**Implementation**

Meta information file can be overwritten with `writePastRecords()` and be read with `readPastRecords()`.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
### 4.6. <a id="logging">Logging</a>
Logging in the application refers to storing exceptions, warnings and messages that occur during the execution of Kitchen Helper. It was included to help developers to identify bugs and to simplify their debugging process. 

The `java.util.logging` package in Java is used for logging. The logging mechanism can be managed from the `SchwarzeneggerLogger` class through the `logger` attribute. 

All controls of the logger for the application can be viewed/ altered in the class construction. The current settings for the logger are as follow:

- All information is logged into a log file, `SchwarzeneggerLogs.log`.
- Logging is made to be displayed in the `SimpleFormatter` style where the date, class and error description are logged.

Logging Levels:
- `Level.SEVERE`: a serious failure, which prevents normal execution of the program, for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.WARNING`: a potential problem, for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.INFO`: reasonably significant informational message for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.CONFIG`: hardware configuration, such as CPU type.
- `Level.FINE`, `Level.FINER`, `Level.FINEST`: three levels used for providing tracing information for the software developers.

`SchwarzeneggerLogger` follows singleton design pattern. Thus, other classes can access the `logger` by calling `SchwarzeneggerLogger.getInstanceLogger()`, and logging can be done by invoking the function `log()`. This will ensure that all loggings will be made to the same file across the various classes. 

An example is shown below:

```
private static Logger logger = SchwarzeneggerLogger.getInstanceLogger();
logger.log(Level.WARNING, DESCRIPTION_OF_WARNING, e.toString());
```

### 5.2. <a id="types-of-tests">Types of Tests</a>
We have use types of tests:

1. Unit tests targeting the lowest level methods/classes.<br>
e.g. profile.UtilsTest

1. Integration tests that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working).
e.g. storage.profile.ProfileStorageTest

1. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.
e.g. logic.LogicManagerTest

### 6.5. <a id="managing-dependencies">Managing Dependencies</a>
Currently, the [Gson library](#https://github.com/google/gson) is being used for JSON parsing, and the [Apache Commons Lang](#https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang) for being used for string processing in The Schwarzenegger. Below are 2 ways to manage these dependencies.
- Use Gradle to manage and automatically download dependencies (Recommended).
- Manually download and include those libraries in the repo (this requires extra work and bloats the repo size).
