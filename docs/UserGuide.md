This section includes 4 sub-sections which will guide you through the features available in Main Menu, Profile Menu, Workout Menu and Diet Menu of the Schwarzenegger. In explaining the syntax, we will adhere to the following format:

***
**Command Format** [Khoa]

- Words that are in `[UPPER_CASE]` format are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
**Example**: in <br>`add /n [NAME] /h [HEIGHT] /w [CURRENT_WEIGHT] /e [EXPECTED_WEIGHT] /c [DAILY_CALORIE_INTAKE]` <br>command, `[NAME]`, `[HEIGHT]`, `[CURRENT_WEIGHT]`, `[EXPECTED_WEIGHT]` and `[DAILY_CALORIE_INTAKE]` are parameters which can be used as `add /n Schwarzenegger /h 188 /w 113 /e 100 /c 2500`.
- Words that are enclosed with `<` and `>` are optional parameters. If all of the parameters are optional, you need to supply at least 1 of them. <br>
**Example**: in <br>`edit </n [NAME]> </h [HEIGHT]> </w [CURRENT_WEIGHT]> </e [EXPECTED_WEIGHT]> </c [DAILY_CALORIE_INTAKE]>` <br>command, `</n [NAME]>`, `</h [HEIGHT]>`, `</w [CURRENT_WEIGHT]>`, `</e [EXPECTED_WEIGHT]>` and `</c [DAILY_CALORIE_INTAKE]>` are optional parameters which can be used as `edit /h 180`, `edit /h 180 /w 50` or `edit /h 180 /w 50 /e 55`. Since all of them are optional parameters, you need to supply at least 1 of them.
- Optional parameters with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. <br>
**Example**: for `<TAG>...`, the following format for Search Command in Workout Menu: `search </d [DATE]> </t [TAG]...>` can be used as `search /t le` or `search /t chest, bicep`.
- Parameters can be in any order. <br> 
**Example**: if the command specifies `/n [NAME] /h [HEIGHT] /w [CURRENT_WEIGHT] /e [EXPECTED_WEIGHT] /c [DAILY_CALORIE_INTAKE]`, `/h [HEIGHT] /w [CURRENT_WEIGHT] /n [NAME] /c [DAILY_CALORIE_INTAKE] /e [EXPECTED_WEIGHT]` is also acceptable.

You can search records created on a specific day with `/d` followed by a date. You should key in your date following one of the supported formats. [See here](#notes) for a complete list of format supported.
