        + Functionality: This enhancement allows the user to search for specific workout sessions created on a certain date range or containing certain tags.

    + **Command Library**
        + Functionality: This enhancement organises the commands into a hashmap and retrieves correct Command object using user's input as key.
        + Justification: This feature improves the code neatness and reduce long selection statement for menus with many availble commands. 
         
    + **Design Workout Session Meta-info File**
        + Functionality: This enhancement creates the program create a file to store the meta-information of past workout sessions. 
        + Justification: This allows the program not to have to load every past session files at one go but only need to load the meta-information of each session. This greatly reduce the initialization time and makes the program more scalable. Past record files are only loaded on request.
