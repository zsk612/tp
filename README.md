1. **Import the project _as a Gradle project_**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).
1. **Verify the set up**: After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/seedu/duke/Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
